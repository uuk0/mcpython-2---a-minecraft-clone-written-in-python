You might also like [his] other Minecraft clone written in C using modern OpenGL (GL shader language). It performs better, has better terrain generation and saves state to a sqlite database. See here:

Goals and Vision

I would like to see this project turn into an educational tool. Kids love Minecraft and Python is a great first language. This is a good opportunity to get children excited about programming.

The code should become well commented and more easily configurable. It should be easy to make some simple changes and see the results quickly.

I think it would be great to turn the project into more of a library / API... a Python package that you import and then use / configure to setup a world and run it. Something along these lines...

import mc

world = mc.World(...) DONE. use G.window = window.Window(...)
world.set_block(x, y, z, mc.DIRT) DONE. use G.model.add_block(x, y, z, <name>)
mc.run(world) DONE. use pyglet.app.run()

The API could contain functionality for the following:

    Easily configurable parameters like gravity, jump velocity, walking speed, etc. DONE
    Hooks for terrain generation.
